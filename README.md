# Alienfahndung / Alienhunt

Welcome to my first Python Project!

In this project I try to explore Python by creating a game. I decided to implement Turtle as I started out with it in my Python journey. In the end I have created a silly text-adventure game. Despite the rough edges this project enabled me to engage in Python in a very fun and creative way. This project was done in December 2021. Sine then I have improved my programming skills and therefore I would do a lot of things differently. Nevertheless, I like looking back to my first programming project and see how far I have come from there.
